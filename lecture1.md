## What is the Internet?
- global infrastructure that connects computers
- hosts = end systems
  - running netowrk apps
  - billions of connected computing devices
- communication links
  - fiber, copper, radio, ...

- routers and switches
  - packet switching: forward packets (chunks of data)

- network edge
  - hosts: clients and servers
  - servers often in data centers
- access networks, physical media: 
  - wired, wireless communication links
