# Lecture 1

## What is the Internet?
- global infrastructure that connects computers
- hosts = end systems
  - running netowrk apps
  - billions of connected computing devices
- communication links
  - fiber, copper, radio, ...
  - transmission rate: bandwidth
- routers and switches
  - packet switching: forward packets (chunks of data)

## A closer look at network structure
- network edge
  - hosts: clients and servers
  - servers often in data centers
- access networks, physical media: 
  - wired, wireless communication links
  - (usually what is slow)
- network core:
  - interconnected routers
  - network of networks

## Access network: digital subscriber line (DSL)
- use existing telphone line to central office DSLAM

## Access network: home network
- cable or DSL modem

## Enterprise access networks (Ethernet)
- typically used in companies, universities, etc.
- 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps transmission rates
- today, end systems typically connect into Ethernet switch

## Wireless access networks
- shared wireless access network connects end system to router
  - via base station aka "access point"
- wireless LANs
  - within building
- wide-area wireless access
  - provided by telco (cellular) operator, 10's km
  - between 1 and 10 Mbps
  - 3G, 4G, 5G, 3G, LTE, LTE-A, 5G

## Physical media
- bit: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- physical link: what lies between transmitter & receiver
- guided media:
  - signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
- unguided media:
  - signals propagate freely, e.g., radio
- twisted pair (TP)
  - two insulated copper wires
- coaxial cable
- fiber optic cable
